/**
 * Interface for ImageJ tools. A tool is a collection of rules binding user
 * input (e.g., keyboard and mouse events) to display and data manipulation in a
 * coherent way.
 * <p>
 * For example, a {@code PanTool} might pan a display when the mouse is dragged
 * or arrow key is pressed, while a {@code PencilTool} could draw hard lines on
 * the data within a display.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Tools discoverable at runtime must implement this interface and be annotated
 * with @{@link Plugin} with {@link Plugin#type()} = {@link Tool}.class. While
 * it possible to create a tool merely by implementing this interface, it is
 * encouraged to instead extend {@link AbstractTool}, for convenience.
 * </p>
