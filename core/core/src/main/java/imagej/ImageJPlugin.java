/**
 * Top-level interface for ImageJ plugins.
 * <p>
 * Plugins discoverable at runtime must implement this interface (usually a
 * subinterface) and be annotated with @{@link Plugin}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The core types of ImageJ plugins are as follows:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link imagej.command.Command} - plugins that are executable. These
 * plugins typically perform a discrete operation, and are accessible via the
 * ImageJ menus.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.tool.Tool} - plugins that map user input (e.g., keyboard
 * and mouse actions) to behavior. They are usually rendered as icons in the
 * ImageJ toolbar.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.display.Display} - plugins that visualize objects, often
 * used to display module outputs.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.widget.InputWidget} - plugins that render UI widgets for
 * the {@link imagej.widget.InputHarvester} preprocessor.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.module.process.PreprocessorPlugin} - plugins that perform
 * preprocessing on modules. A preprocessor plugin is a discoverable
 * {@link imagej.module.process.ModulePreprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.module.process.PostprocessorPlugin} - plugins that perform
 * postprocessing on modules. A
 * {@link imagej.module.process.PostprocessorPlugin} is a discoverable
 * {@link imagej.module.process.ModulePostprocessor}.</li>
 * <li>{@link imagej.platform.Platform} - plugins for defining platform-specific
 * behavior.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There is also one very important non-ImageJ-specific plugin type:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.scijava.service.Service} - plugins that define new API in a
 * particular area.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * What all plugins have in common is that they are declared using an annotation
 * (@{@link Plugin}), and discovered if present on the classpath at runtime.
 * </p>
